## üîó About me

I'm a 4th-year Physics student with a strong interest in **theoretical physics**, particularly in **quantum field theory (QFT)**, **relativity**, and **emergent phenomena**.  
I am currently working on a Bachelor's thesis related with Quantum Electrodynamics, and I‚Äôm always looking for opportunities to deepen my understanding and knowledge.

This portfolio reflects my academic development, especially in the use of **Python** for simulation and **LaTeX** for scientific documentation.

Feel free to explore each folder ‚Äî this portfolio is an ongoing reflection of my learning journey.
